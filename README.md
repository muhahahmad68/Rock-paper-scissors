# Rock-paper-scissors
A game in which two players display one of three symbols: a rock, paper, or scissors. A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it, 
and paper beats rock by covering it. In this simulation, the game is between computer and a player.
A win adds 100 to a player's score, draw adds 50 else the score remains.
